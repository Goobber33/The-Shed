## 🏋️‍♀️ About The Shed Gym

At The Shed, we offer group personal training and personal training on site and online. Each of our workouts are researched, thought out, and created with the client’s goals and bodies in mind. We believe in building a base and a strong body, gradually. We provide monthly programs or new workouts each session, depending on each client’s interest. We also offer general memberships for gym use only. No sign up fees or commitment beyond a month. All members have 24/7 lockbox access to the gym.
